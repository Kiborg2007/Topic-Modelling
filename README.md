# Topic-Modelling
Topic modelling of Russian President's transcripts using R.

Analysis was built on a database of more than 10,000 transcripts published on the official website `http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts` of the President of Russia since December 31, 1999.

The appeals of national leaders can influence public support and stimulate changes in the country's economy. They can set long-term trends and prompt immediate action. Therefore, the study of transcripts can be useful both for understanding the content of topics and for assessing the impact of the dynamics of changes in the discussion of topics. This paper examines transcripts from the Kremlin's website for the period from December 31, 1999 to December 31, 2020. The transcripts contain a variety of materials: messages to the Federal Assembly, statements on major issues, meetings and sessions, speeches and addresses, press conferences and interviews.
Thus, the research question of the work is to understand the content of the Kremlin transcripts and assess the dynamics of changes in the discussion of topics and suggest how these changes were related.
The research objectives included literature analysis, justification of the chosen method of analysis, thematic analysis, and interpretation of the results obtained.
